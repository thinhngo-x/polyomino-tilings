Modified name free -> fixed.

Added method Enumeration.fixedPolyominoes to enumerate all of the fixed polyominoes.

Algorithm now works better and produces correct answers for p up to 17. Did not test for the rest.

I'll add a method to generate the general test case (X has n elements, C has k elements) later.
